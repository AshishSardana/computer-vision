## Product Categorization for Inventory Management

### Requirements:

The project is done in "pytorch". The main source code for the library "[fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai)" must be forked/cloned to be enable to verify the results. Place the notebook inside ./courses/dl1

Though the library is in it's beta development, its very stable for deploying deep learning models built on torch.

Highly recommend contributing to its development.

The complete notebook was running on cloud for GPU instances.
